                TrainUp is a web application built with Java, Spring Framework, Hibernate, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It helps students find, enroll in, and keep track of their courses. In addition, if the user has permission, they can create courses and view statistics about the course. This project was completed as part of the requirements for 
                the completion of the Perficient BrightPaths Java Specializations Capstone Project. Working on this project strengthened my skills in Java and taught me how to build a robust, optimized back-end.

                The Writers' Collaborative is a full-stack JavaScript social networking web application in which users can store their stories and, 
                if they choose, share them with other people. This project was completed as part of the requirements for 
                the completion of the Perficient BrightPaths Foundations Capstone Project. Working on this project taught me 
                how to effectively serve static files from the server and get better practice with SQL queries. 
                For example, there was a situation in which I wanted to select everything by one value and order by another, but 
                the query I was using at the time required me to include a value into the group by clause that I did not 
                want to include. After searching and consulting with my instructor, I found that the best solution was 
                to use a subquery to create a table that was already grouped and ordered.

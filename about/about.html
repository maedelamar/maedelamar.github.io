                I am a recent college graduate and recent graduate of the Pericient BrightPaths Software Engineering Boot Camp. 
                In 2023, I graduated Magna Cum Laude from Southeastern Louisiana University with a Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics and Scientific Computation with a 
                minor in Creative Writing. 
                I first learned to code in the summer of 2019 when I took a required "Introduction to Java" course and 
                fell in love with it. Ever since, I have pursued individual projects and have sought to further my understanding 
                of computer science. 
                After I graduated, I decided to enroll into the Perficient Bright Paths Program, where I improved my 
                technical and personal abilities to prepare for a career in technology.

                This was a video game development project for a university survey of programming languages course. 
                The purpose of this project was to learn an obscure language in a short period of time 
                and use it to create an application.

            <p class="project-desc">
                The Writers' Collaborative is a social networking web application in which users can store their stories and, 
                if they choose, share them with other people. This project was completed as part of the requirements for 
                the completion of the Perficient BrightPaths Foundations Capstone Project. Wroking on this project taught me 
                how to effectively serve static files from the server and get better practice with SQL queries. 
                For example, there was a situation in which I wanted to select everything by one value and order by another, but 
                the query I was using at the time required me to include a value into the group by clause that I did not 
                want to include. After searching and consulting with my instructor, I found that the best solution was 
                to use a subquery to create a table that was already grouped and ordered.
